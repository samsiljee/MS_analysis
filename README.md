# MS_analysis
Repository to set up R workflows for my MS data

Initial code is based off of the tutorial by Dr Laurent Gatto, see my tutrial repo for details https://github.com/samsiljee/MS_for_proteomics_tutorial

First section is to have a basic look at the raw MS data, note that it will need to be converted to mzML format first; I have made a PD workflow for this.
